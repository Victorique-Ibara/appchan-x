# Appchan X fixes for Chrome
To add this to chrome, do the following:
  - Clone repo
  - Open Chrome Extensions window
  - Turn on developer mode
  - Drag folder into Chrome's extensions window
Alternately, a packaged CRX is available in releases.


# Get Appchan X [HERE](http://zixaphir.github.io/appchan-x/).

1. Make sure both your **browser** and **Appchan X** are up to date.
2. Disable your other extensions & scripts to identify conflicts.
3. If your issue persists, open a [new issue](https://github.com/zixaphir/appchan-x/issues) with the following information:
  1. Precise steps to reproduce the problem, with the expected and actual results.
  2. Console errors, if any.
  3. Browser version.
  4. Your exported settings. If your settings contains sensitive information (e.g. personas), edit the text file manually.

### If you have any problems, try resetting your Appchan X settings before calling me a faggot (but feel free to do so)
